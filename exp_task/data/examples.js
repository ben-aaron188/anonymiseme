In my second year, I have been to Bali to work in a hotel, named Kelapa Retreat and Spa as an internship. I worked there as a receptionist and learned how to surf, because the hotel was on the beach. In my last year, I have been to Buenos Aires to work at the Melia Recoleta Plaza Hotel as a chef cook, also as an internship. I finished the Hotelschool in 2013, and after that I have worked on different locations of the Hilton Hotel, such as Amsterdam, Dubai, New York and Rome. I have worked there as a chef cook. Last year, I got a job offer from the Kelapa Retreat and Spa on Bali, to work there as the hotel manager. ",

I work with seven lawyers, but I am the secretary of Gabriel Meijers. He is the owner of the place and such a nice man. The secretary of Kerem Canatan, Judy, is one of my best friends. Two other secretaries, Pippa and Kiki, are twins. The four of us are friends and we do lots of nice things together, like going out or having dinner. On working hours, all of the lawyers are very serious and formal, but after working hours we usually go out for a drink, especially on fridays. ",
