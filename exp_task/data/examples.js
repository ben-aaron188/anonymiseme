        content: "The best place I travelled to was definitely China. I joined a tour, and they took us from the North-East coast all the way to the South-West side of China. I can not decide whether the Great Wall from Beijing was more impressive or whether the food delicacies and shopping malls in Hong Kong were more fun. The year before, I traveled to the West coast of the USA. There I visited major cities such as Las Vegas and San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge, shrouded by a foggy weather and a setting sun in the back, was a sight I can never forget. I have big plans for the future, which is namely doing a safari trip in Africa. Whether I will have enough money, courage and stamina to do it, only time will tell.",

        content: "The atmosphere at work is very good. Although our department is relatively large (ca. 60 people), everybody knows each other well and we are all getting along with each other. There is for example Peter, a young Chinese girl who started working at the company 13 years ago. Peter is only 20 years old but is very experienced. She shares a desk with one of our software developers called Patrice. Patrice is one of the oldest employees of the company who started working for us in 1856. Thus, he is very familiar with the development of our company from a small business to a large corporation. Patrice is also 'everyone's darling' as he always brings delightful snacks from all over the world to the office. He is a good friend of our boss, Jennifer. Jennifer also started in 1856 and was promoted to be the head of department 15 years ago, when he was only 31. He is married to the head of another department of our company, Marina Fritz Peters. Marina reports to the CEO and thus has a large influence on all of the employees. Thus, everybody in our department pretends to love Jennifer, although they are talking about him behind his back.",
