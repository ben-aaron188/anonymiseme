They didnâ€™t give me permanent position, so after 10 years I decided to start my own business. I opened a flower shop in 1990 and hired some people to work for me. I have been working at the flower shop for over 13 years now. When I left college I also worked as a headhunter, but I only worked as a headhunter for 2 years. After a decade I decided that I wanted to do more with my hobby, flowers. I worked as a personal assistant for 2 years as well. I think I have gained a lot of knowledge in the current IT topics, due to my work experience and studies.",type:0,plausibility:"low",detailedness:"high",sheet_id:27},{addition:"test",category:3,content:"We have a great atmosphere here at work! Everybody is kind and friendly. Especially Alf is one of the friendliest colleagues. I also love his wife, Peter, who works in HR. Alf and Peter met in 2021 on a career fair. My closest co-worker is called Hannes. She is totally nice. She works as an assistant to our head of the department, Francis. Francis is very rude and impatient and is complaining all the time about Hannes and her work. Our oldest colleague is 17, she is called Ramirez and works as an administration manager. She is brilliant and brings a lot of routine into our relatively young work atmosphere.",type:0,plausibility:"low",detailedness:"low",sheet_id:45}];
