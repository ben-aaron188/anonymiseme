In my second year, I have been to Bali to work in a hotel, named Kelapa Retreat and Spa as an internship. I worked there as a receptionist and learned how to surf, because the hotel was on the beach. In my last year, I have been to Buenos Aires to work at the Melia Recoleta Plaza Hotel as a chef cook, also as an internship. I finished the Hotelschool in 2013, and after that I have worked on different locations of the Hilton Hotel, such as Amsterdam, Dubai, New York and Rome. I have worked there as a chef cook. Last year, I got a job offer from the Kelapa Retreat and Spa on Bali, to work there as the hotel manager. ",

        content: "I love the atmosphere at work. I work at a law firm named Meijers Canatan Advocaten as a secretary. The firm is located at the Herengracht in Amsterdam. I work with seven lawyers, but I am the secretary of Gabriel Meijers. He is the owner of the place and such a nice man. The secretary of Kerem Canatan, Judy, is one of my best friends. Two other secretaries, Pippa and Kiki, are twins. The four of us are friends and we do lots of nice things together, like going out or having dinner. On working hours, all of the lawyers are very serious and formal, but after working hours we usually go out for a drink, especially on fridays. ",

        content: "My first choice travel destination is definitely the city Krakau. I have been there on my interrail trip in 2012 with two of my friends, Hannah and Kate. It is such a lovely town with a beautiful square and very nice people. A nice extra is that it is very cheap. Another beautiful city is Venice. I have been there twice. All the little canals, the Saint Mark’s square and the gondolas are so beautiful. One big disadvantage, in the months of june till september it’s very crowded with tourists. Another one of my top travel destinations is New York city. I’ve been there in 2013 with my boyfriend on New Year's Eve. We watched the firework on Times Square and visited the Statue of Liberty, Central Park and the Empire State Building. Our hotel was in Soho, such a nice neighbourhood. In 2015 I’ve visit Ibiza with my friend Hannah. It is an island full of contradictions. I really liked the sunset on Cala Comte. My last destination is Seville. It is another beautiful city in Europe, with lovely people and delicious food. I have eaten so many tapas over there and drank so much Tinto de Verano. I have been there in 2012 on a study trip with my study association Los Guiris.",

We stayed there for 4 days, and after that we went to Budapest. In Vienna, we visited the Zoo and saw the panda’s. We also saw the Palace of Princess Sisi, Schloss Schonbrunn. On the fourth day, we took the train to Budapest and stayed at the Aria Hotel in Budapest, one of the best hotels in town. We visited the Fisher’s Bastion and one of the many spas in Budapest. Unfortunately, my boyfriend got sick on the third day and we had to go to the hospital, because he had appendicitis. After 4 days in the hospital, we finally could travel back home to Amsterdam.",
