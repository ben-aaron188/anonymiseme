I was more than happy to do so, since my graduation meant that I could finally leave Harderwijk, the small and boring home town where I grew up. In February 2012, I decided to move to Granada, Spain, to learn Spanish. Studying here for four months, I was able to wander a lot through the city, and discover all its gems, like the Alhambra palace, the beautiful Generalife gardens, and the Albaicín quarter. A few months after my return to Harderwijk, in September 2012, I chose to study Political Science at the University of Amsterdam. After one year, I started studying Psychology as well. During my student life, I took several jobs as a waitress in bars and restaurants. In 2012 I worked at De Notenkraker, a bit of a shabby but charming, old café serving great soups and pies, with a lot of weird customers in the east of Amsterdam. One year later, in 2013, I started working at Cafe Snoek, a brewery with home-crafted beers, steaks and burgers, and sometimes yuppie customers.",type:0,plausibility:"high",detailedness:"high",sheet_id:5},{category:1,content:"In 2008, I graduated from the Myspace high school in 2010.
