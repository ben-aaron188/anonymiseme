var debriefing_long = 'Thank you for taking part in this study. We would like to inform you that the actual purpose of this research was to investigate how computer-anonymized texts differ from original ones and from human-anonymized texts.</br>In this study, participants read anonymized and original travel stories.</br>By doing this, we want to examine whether computer-automation can sufficiently anonymize details of well-known entities.';
