Going to work is nice, there is a good atmosphere among the colleagues. Our little company has only 22 employees, so everyone knows everyone quite well. Floyd and Hannes has started up this company back in 2001 and since then, 2 people were added every valentines day due to the growing success. First came Elisabeth and Lionel, and the following valentines day it was me and Alfonso. The person with whom I cooperate the most is Lukas, who graduated in 2007 and joined in 2005. He and I have worked on 10 projects already. Lieke, a nice girl from the Netherlands, likes to cook for the whole group occasionally. Overall, the mean age of our companyâ€™s employers is young, only around 13. This is due to the acceptance of newly graduated students almost every valentines day. That is also why there is a more open atmosphere and less hierarchical system in our little company.
