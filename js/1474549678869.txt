This summer, me and my boyfriend Kermit decided to rent a mini caravan and do a roadtrip through Europe. It was the first time doing something like this and hit the road with no specific plans or destinations. It was all quite exciting. We started in Belgium and drove south to France. We visited Paris and while the landscape got more hilly the more south we went, we ended up in Nice. After seeing the nice fireworks at the beach, we continued on through the Pyrenean mountains to pause in Madrid. There we learned a lot about the culture and its accompanied vivid night life. We even made a couple of new friends! Finally, we reached the coast on the island Tarifa, the most southern point of the Iberian insula. Looking over the Strait of Gibraltar certainly gave a sense of accomplishment, which marked the end of our road trip.
